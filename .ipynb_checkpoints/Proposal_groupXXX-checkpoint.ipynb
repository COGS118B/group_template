    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to delete this description section when you hand in your proposal."

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose to develop an unsupervised machine learning model to recommend books to users based on their interactions and preferences. We will harness two datasets: `goodreads_book_genres_initial.json`, which contains information on books and their genres, and `goodreads_interactions.csv`, which details user interactions with books, including readings, reviews, and ratings. The proposed model will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: We will use the top 20,000 rows from `goodreads_interactions.csv`, as these users have read the most books and thus can provide more information for us to train our model. We will also randomly sample 80,000 books from `goodreads_book_genres_initial.json` to ensure a sufficiently large sample. The `rating` and `has_read` fields from `goodreads_interactions.csv` will be dropped. Since we need to use `has_read` for our book recommendation algorithm later, and `rating` to test how effective is our model at the end. The two datasets will then be merged to correlate users' interactions with specific book genres, enabling a comprehensive view of user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: We will focus on the genres of books a user has read to summarize their book preferences.We belive the genres feature can capture the user preference for books since users tend to prefer certain genres depending ontheir personalities or experiences, and they tend to keep this preference for genres for long term.The aggregated data will be normalized to ensure uniformity and facilitate meaningful comparison between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clustering with K-Means**: K-Means clustering will be implemented to group users based on their normalized interaction profiles. The initial number of clusters (k) will be chosen based on domain knowledge and refined using silhouette analysis to ensure optimal cluster quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Book Recommendations**: Books will be recommended to users based on cluster membership. A book read by one user in a cluster can be recommended to another user in the same cluster who has not yet interacted with that book.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implementation Details**: We plan to use Python for implementation, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for K-Means clustering and silhouette analysis, and NumPy for numerical operations. Code reproducibility will be ensured by using our class conda environment and providing step-by-step execution instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing the Solution\n",
    "To test our solution, we will focus on the ratings provided by users to assess the effectiveness of our recommendations. Specifically, we will evaluate whether users within the same cluster tend to give higher ratings to books that are commonly read and appreciated within their cluster. This approach presupposes that effective recommendations should align with users' existing preferences, as indicated by their ratings. The testing strategy will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rating Analysis within Clusters**: We will calculate the average rating for books within each cluster that are recommended based on shared interests. This will involve comparing the average ratings of recommended books to a baseline to assess the quality of recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Validation**: A form of cross-validation tailored for unsupervised learning will be implemented, where a portion of user interactions is held out from the clustering process. We will predict their ratings for unseen books based on cluster averages. These predicted ratings will then be compared to the actual ratings to measure accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Benchmarking: As a benchmark, we will use a simple popularity-based recommendation system, where the most popular books across the entire dataset are recommended to every user. The performance of our unsupervised model will be compared against this benchmark to demonstrate its effectiveness in providing personalized recommendations.\n"

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric that we propose to quantify the performance of both the benchmark and solution models is the **Cluster-Based Rating Consistency (CBRC)**. This metric assesses the homogeneity of ratings within clusters and the alignment of recommendations with users' preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Representation**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CBRC} = \\frac{1}{N_c} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_c} \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in C_i} (r_j - \\bar{r}_{C_i})^2}{|C_i|} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $N_c$ is the number of clusters,\n",
    "- $C_i$ is the set of books recommended to the $i$th cluster,\n",
    "- $r_j$ is the rating given to the $j$th book within cluster $C_i$,\n",
    "- $bar{r}_{C_i}$ is the average rating of books within cluster $C_i$,\n",
    "- $|C_i|$ is the number of books in cluster $C_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBRC metric will allow us to evaluate the consistency of recommendations across the user clusters, with lower values indicating higher consistency and alignment with user preferences. By comparing the CBRC scores of the benchmark model and our solution model, we can quantitatively determine which model provides more relevant and personalized recommendations."
