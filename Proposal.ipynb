    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "We are aiming to predict the discount price of games in Steam. Games in steam are all labeled with tags and features, which makes it perfect for clustering algorithms. Though tags are generated by users, we can still transform it into one-hot encoding for it to be quantifiable. Measuring should be easy as we can use accuracy for predict prices, or use distance for clustering performance. We will use fixed seed to ensure the algorithm is replicable."
