    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Abstract  \n",
    "The goal for this project is to be able to predict who the next super bowl winner is based on their stats.\n",
    "The first dataset is the NFL team stats from 1998-2019. These are the logged stats of each team in the NFL per season. It includes the number of wins, losses, yards, and more. The second dataset is the super bowl teams. This includes the winner, loser, points, and location.  \n",
    "We will be using the team stats and the winners of the super bowls to create a prediction model in order to predict who winner of the superbowl is based off their season stats. This means that we would need to break our dataset into a training set, validation set, and test set.\n",
    "Performance/success would be measured based on if it is accurately able to predict the superbowl winners of previous years."

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "With all of the different ways to predict a super bowl winner out on the internet, whether that be through puppies prediciting the winner or conspiracies such as whoever is the bottom color of the super bowl logo, we wanted to see if there was a way to use machine learning to accurately predict who the winner of the super bowl is, and in turn the score of the super bowl game. There are a variety of different machine learning algorithms that can be used to accurately predict sports. We found that there has been some research on using machine learning to predict sports outcomes. We start to look at the different machine learning algorithms and which would best be used for sports. There has been better accuracy  with neural networks in regards to sports predictions and these are not dependent on the number of seasons that are included in the data <a name =\"horvat\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#horvatnote). Each sport also has a specific algorithm that works best for the sport, where football was best predicted using CART or ANN trained with BP <a name=\"bunker\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#bunkernote). This led to seeing that for football,  classification models predict game outcomes better than regression models <a name=\"dursun\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#dursunnote). A lot of the research done on sports predictions focus on the winner of the game. We wanted to go more indepth and see if we can find a way to more accurately predict the winner by also predicting the score of the game and go beyond that to find if we can predict who ends up at the super bowl based off their stats."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal within this project is to aggregate all of the data from the past superbowl winners as well as current statistics to help predict who the next Super Bowl winner will be. We plan on using dimensionality reduction to help eliminate less important features and filter out any of the noise in the data. By reducing the dimensionality it will also help us when we use clustering algorithms by making the computation more efficient for us. Once we have done dimensionality reduction we plan on clustering the data by grouping teams based on similarities in a variety of performance metrics as well as characteristics. We are hoping to identify certain patterns that could indicate potential for Super Bowl success. Some dimensions that the data may be clustered by is offensive and defensive strategies, key player statistics, past playoff performance, and more.After doing our clustering we want to look at the identifying characteristics and performance metrics of each cluster to see how the clusters differentiate themselves. We are going to be looking at the key features that Super Bowl winners have within specific clusters. Then we will do  testing that  will use internal validation such as a silhouette score to assess the quality of the clusters formed, allowing us to see how similar a data point is in their cluster. We can then use those insights that we have gained from the clustering to develop predictive models to see the likelihood of which team will win the Super Bowl.  \n",

    "Although predicting the Super Bowl winner may seem straightforward it can have unintended consequences when it comes to delving deeper into data privacy and fairness. When it comes to data privacy we have to make sure that the collection and analysis of the player as well as the team statistics does not involve any personal data, without the proper consent this could infringe on privacy rights. We also have to make sure that the machine learning models that we use do not perpetuate any biases present in current data such as undervaluing certain players who may be less popular or have less coverage in the media. If they have less coverage this could affect predictions and mess with the machine learning algorithms. To ensure that we are implementing a fair model we must add in techniques that identify and mitigate biases in the data and model predictions. To do this we can audit the outcomes of the model to ensure fairness within the groups. An ethical concern that we may have is that if more people continue to use predictive models in sports it could lead to social and economic consequences such as player market values, team strategies, and overall enjoyment for fans. To help with this issue we must be transparent with why we are using predictive modeling which is to help with the analytics in sports not to destroy the wonders of the game. By addressing these issues it can help us be more open with our audience and address as well as solve some of our concerns.\n",
