Punctuation marks usually do not carry significant meaning on their own and can introduce unnecessary noise in the text data. By removing punctuation, the text is standardized, making it easier for the model to process and analyze. Additionally, punctuation marks are typically treated as separate tokens during tokenization, and removing them helps create cleaner and more meaningful
